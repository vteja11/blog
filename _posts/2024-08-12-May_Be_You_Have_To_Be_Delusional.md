Maybe being delusional is the only way you can do great things in life.

This thought has been bouncing around my head for weeks now. Every time I look at people who've achieved something extraordinary - whether it's building a successful startup, mastering a difficult skill, or even just sticking to a challenging goal - there's always this element of... well, delusion.

## The Rational Trap

Here's the thing about being purely rational: it's paralyzing.

If I were to rationally assess my chances of building something meaningful, the numbers would be discouraging. The statistics on startup failures, the odds of breaking into competitive fields, the probability of standing out in a world of 8 billion people - it's all pretty grim when you really think about it.

But maybe that's the problem. Maybe thinking about it too much is exactly what stops most people from even trying.

## The Delusional Advantage

I've started noticing a pattern in the stories of people I admire:

- The developer who quit their stable job to build an app everyone said was unnecessary
- The writer who spent years on a book despite having no publishing connections
- The entrepreneur who believed they could compete with billion-dollar companies

Were they delusional? By most rational standards, absolutely. Did some of them fail? Of course. But the ones who succeeded - they had to believe in something that wasn't yet real.

## The Fine Line

There's obviously a difference between productive delusion and harmful self-deception. The key seems to be in the direction of the delusion:

**Harmful delusion**: Ignoring feedback, refusing to adapt, believing you're already perfect
**Productive delusion**: Believing you can become something you're not yet, seeing possibilities others miss, maintaining hope despite setbacks

The first type keeps you stuck. The second type keeps you moving.

## My Own Delusions

I'll be honest - I'm probably delusional about several things right now:

- That this blog will eventually reach people who find value in these thoughts
- That the projects I'm building will make a meaningful difference
- That I can develop skills that currently feel impossibly out of reach

Am I wrong about these things? Maybe. Probably. But here's what I've realized: being wrong about these delusions costs me very little, while being right could change everything.

## The Alternative

The alternative to delusion isn't rationality - it's resignation.

When you strip away all the "unrealistic" dreams, all the "improbable" goals, all the "delusional" ambitions, what's left? A very safe, very predictable, very limited life.

And maybe that's fine for some people. But for those of us who want to create something, build something, become something more than we are right now - maybe a little delusion is exactly what we need.

## The Permission to Dream

Perhaps the real insight here isn't that you *have* to be delusional, but that you have *permission* to be delusional.

Permission to believe in possibilities that don't yet exist.
Permission to work toward outcomes that seem unlikely.
Permission to maintain hope despite evidence to the contrary.

Because here's the beautiful paradox: the moment enough people share the same "delusion," it stops being delusional and starts being reality.

*What are you delusional about? What impossible thing are you secretly hoping might be possible? Sometimes the best ideas start as the most unrealistic ones.*
