Luck is not all you need.

I keep hearing this narrative that success is mostly about luck - being in the right place at the right time, having the right connections, or just getting lucky breaks. And while luck definitely plays a role, I think this perspective is both incomplete and potentially harmful.

## The Luck Obsession

There's something seductive about attributing everything to luck. It explains away other people's success ("they just got lucky") and excuses our own lack of progress ("I'm just unlucky"). It's a neat, simple explanation for the complex messiness of life outcomes.

But I think this obsession with luck is missing something crucial: what you do with the luck you get.

## Preparation Meets Opportunity

The old saying goes: "Luck is when preparation meets opportunity." But I'd go further - luck is when preparation meets opportunity, and you're ready to recognize and act on it.

How many opportunities pass by people every day because they weren't prepared to see them or act on them? How many "lucky breaks" are actually the result of years of groundwork that made someone ready for that moment?

## The Recognition Factor

Here's what I've noticed: "lucky" people seem to be better at recognizing opportunities. They see possibilities where others see problems. They notice connections that others miss. They're more willing to take calculated risks.

Is that really luck, or is that a skill? A mindset? A way of approaching the world that creates more opportunities for good things to happen?

## The Persistence Variable

Most overnight successes took years of work that nobody saw. Most "lucky breaks" came after dozens of attempts that didn't work out. Most successful people have stories of persistence through multiple failures before anything good happened.

Luck might determine when your breakthrough comes, but persistence determines whether you're still in the game when it does.

## Creating Your Own Luck

I've started to believe that you can actually create more luck in your life:

**Say yes more often**: More opportunities lead to more chances for something good to happen
**Meet more people**: Larger networks create more possibilities for connections and opportunities  
**Try more things**: The more experiments you run, the higher your chances of finding something that works
**Stay curious**: Asking questions and exploring leads to discovering things others miss
**Be helpful**: People remember those who help them and are more likely to return favors

These aren't guarantees, but they stack the odds in your favor.

## The Skill of Capitalizing

Even when genuine luck strikes, there's still the question of what you do with it. I've seen people get amazing opportunities and waste them because they weren't prepared or didn't know how to capitalize on them.

The ability to recognize luck when it happens and then maximize it - that's a skill that can be developed.

## The Mindset Difference

People who believe everything is luck often develop a passive approach to life. They wait for things to happen to them rather than making things happen. They don't invest in building skills or relationships because "it's all random anyway."

People who understand that luck is just one factor tend to be more proactive. They prepare, they network, they practice, they try. And ironically, they often seem to get "luckier."

## The Unfairness Reality

Let me be clear: life isn't fair. Some people are born into better circumstances. Some people face systemic barriers others don't. Some people genuinely get more lucky breaks than others.

Acknowledging this isn't the same as saying luck is everything. It's recognizing that while you can't control your starting conditions, you can influence what happens next.

## What You Can Control

You can't control:
- Where you're born
- Your family's economic situation  
- Natural disasters or economic crashes
- Other people's decisions that affect you
- Random events and timing

You can control:
- How hard you work
- What skills you develop
- How you treat people
- How you respond to setbacks
- Whether you keep trying or give up
- How prepared you are for opportunities

## The Compound Effect

Here's what I think really happens: small actions compound over time in ways that look like luck from the outside. The person who reads a little every day eventually becomes knowledgeable. The person who exercises regularly eventually becomes fit. The person who networks consistently eventually has great connections.

When these investments pay off, it might look like they "got lucky," but really they created conditions for good things to happen.

## The Dangerous Narrative

Believing that success is mostly luck can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think effort doesn't matter, you won't put in effort. If you think preparation is pointless, you won't prepare. If you think it's all random, you won't try to influence the outcome.

This mindset actually reduces your chances of getting lucky because you're not doing the things that create opportunities for luck to strike.

## The Balanced View

The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Luck matters - sometimes a lot. But so does preparation, effort, persistence, and the ability to recognize and capitalize on opportunities.

The most successful people I know acknowledge the role of luck in their success while also taking responsibility for the parts they could control. They're grateful for their good fortune while also continuing to work hard and stay prepared.

## Moving Forward

Instead of focusing on whether you're lucky or unlucky, focus on what you can influence:
- Keep building skills
- Keep meeting people  
- Keep trying new things
- Keep showing up consistently
- Keep learning from failures

You can't guarantee luck will strike, but you can make sure you're ready when it does.

*What role do you think luck has played in your life? How much of what seemed like luck was actually preparation meeting opportunity? Sometimes what we call luck is just the visible result of invisible work.*
