Places don't, People matter.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially as I watch people agonize over choosing the "right" city, the "perfect" company, or the "ideal" college. We put so much weight on location, environment, and setting - but maybe we're missing the point entirely.

## The Place Obsession

We live in a culture obsessed with places. The best cities to live in, the coolest neighborhoods, the most innovative companies, the top-ranked universities. We scroll through Instagram feeds of beautiful destinations and think, "If only I could be there, everything would be better."

But I've started to notice something: the people who seem happiest aren't necessarily in the most impressive places. They're the ones surrounded by people who matter to them.

## The Variable That Actually Changes Everything

I've lived in different cities, worked in different environments, studied in different institutions. And here's what I've learned: the place itself rarely makes or breaks the experience. It's always been about the people.

The best job I ever had wasn't at the most prestigious company - it was the one where I worked with people I respected and who challenged me to grow.

The most memorable college experiences weren't in the fanciest buildings - they were late-night conversations with friends who became family.

The cities I miss most aren't the ones with the best weather or infrastructure - they're the ones where I had meaningful connections.

## The Myth of Geographic Solutions

We tell ourselves stories: "I'll be happier when I move to that city," "I'll be more creative in that workspace," "I'll find myself in that new environment." But these are often just elaborate ways of avoiding the harder work of building meaningful relationships where we are.

Geographic solutions are appealing because they feel actionable and concrete. It's easier to change your zip code than to change how you connect with people.

## What People Actually Provide

Good people in your life provide things that no place can:

**Perspective**: They challenge your assumptions, offer different viewpoints, and help you see blind spots.

**Support**: When things get tough, places don't comfort you - people do.

**Growth**: The right people push you to become better, not through judgment but through inspiration and honest feedback.

**Meaning**: Shared experiences with people you care about create the stories that define your life.

**Belonging**: You don't belong to a place; you belong with people who accept and value you.

## The People-First Approach

What if we flipped the script? Instead of asking "Where should I go?" what if we asked "Who do I want to be around?"

Instead of optimizing for the perfect city, what if we optimized for being around people who inspire us, challenge us, and support us?

This doesn't mean place doesn't matter at all - physical environment affects mood, opportunities, and lifestyle. But it means recognizing that people are the primary variable in life satisfaction.

## The Remote Work Revelation

The pandemic taught us something interesting: when forced to separate people from places, many of us realized how much we valued the people. The colleagues we missed weren't the office buildings - they were the conversations, the collaboration, the human connection.

Some people thrived working remotely because they could optimize for relationships over commute times. Others struggled because they lost the casual human interactions that made work meaningful.

## Quality Over Geography

I'd rather live in a mediocre place with extraordinary people than in an extraordinary place with mediocre people. The conversations, the shared experiences, the mutual support - these create the texture of life that no beautiful skyline or perfect weather can provide.

This isn't to say you should settle for places that make you miserable. But it's recognizing that the people variable often matters more than we give it credit for.

## The Investment Question

Here's a thought experiment: if you had to choose between living in your dream city with people who drain your energy, or living in an okay city with people who energize and inspire you, which would you choose?

Most of us, if we're honest, would choose the people. Yet we often make decisions as if the opposite were true.

## Building Wherever You Are

The people-first mindset isn't just about choosing where to go - it's about how to approach wherever you are. Instead of waiting to find yourself in the perfect place, focus on building meaningful connections where you are right now.

The person who can create deep relationships in any environment is more adaptable and ultimately happier than the person who needs the perfect setting to thrive.

## The Paradox

Here's the interesting paradox: when you focus on people over places, you often end up in better places anyway. Why? Because the right people will either improve wherever you are, or they'll move to better places and bring you along.

Good people are mobile assets. Great places without great people are just pretty backgrounds.

*Think about your happiest memories - how many of them are about places versus people? What relationships have shaped your life more than any location ever could? Sometimes the best place to be is wherever your people are.*
