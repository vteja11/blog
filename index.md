title: "Thought Logs"

Thoughts, beliefs, and stories from my perspective. An interesting thought experiment would be looking back and seeing if I still hold the same beliefs, thoughts, and convictions - that's exactly why I'm documenting this stuff.

I'm naturally curious with an open mind and try to keep my bias minimal (i feel this is what separates us from AI). I try to look at the world objectively, so i welcome you to challenge my beliefs, opinions and perspectives.
